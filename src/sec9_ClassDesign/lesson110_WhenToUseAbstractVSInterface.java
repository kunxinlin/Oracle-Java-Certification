/* Abstract Class
* -share code among closely related classes ex. Animal
* -expect subclasses to have many common methods and fields or require private or protected access modifiers
* -you want to declare non static or non final fields, this enable you to define methods that can access and modify the state of object
* -can have constructors
*/


/* Interface
 * -unrelated classes that would implement your interface
 * -you want to separate behaviors
